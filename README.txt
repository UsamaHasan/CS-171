Within each part, just run "make" on the command line.

In parts 1, 2, 3, the executable is ./my_prog, in part 4 the executable is ./ppm_test. Also in part 1, my main loop is in Parse.cpp, but in all other parts my main loop is in main.cpp.

Note that in part 1, there are separate class files that I made but aren't necessary to handle or compile separately.
